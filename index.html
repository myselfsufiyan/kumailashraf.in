      <ol>
        <li>
          “A sword made of iron cuts through a disbeliever, but a sword of love cuts through his disbelief and he enters Islam.”
        </li>
        <li>
          “There are three types of eyes:<br>
            (a) The ones with which people see;<br>
            (b) The evil eye which can prove to be fatal and deadly; <br>
            (c) And if the blessed sight of a wali Allah (saint) falls on a person, his life and afterlife will be blessed.”
        </li>
        <li>
          “Always forgive people. As he explained in a couplet:<br>
          <em>‘Mujaahid ka wo naara ho ke koh o dasht tharraae, <br>
          Magar dushman bhi zakhmi ho to kheme me utha laaye.’</em><br>
          (Rough meaning: Even if the enemy is wounded, one should bring him into his own tent to heal him.)”
